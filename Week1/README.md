## Week goals
All of the detailed information about every concept is in your study book. The following goal explanation will link you to the correct place to get studying. Read through the goal description once to get an idea of what you will be learning, then go through the different links (either from the agenda or this goal list).

This week we will learn about how we can use JavaScript to react to user interactions and change the website on the fly. We'll start off by learning about browsers [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/browser). After that we will look into something called the DOM that forms the framework of how a website is built, read all about that [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/dom). Then the fun part starts and we will have a look at how all the things we learned in the previous module can be used to actually interact with this DOM and adjust to pretty much anything the user does. Have a look [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/dom-manipulation).

Besides that we will also work on our soft skills by following the first week of the presentation module. Have a look [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module/blob/main/week1.md) to see what is expected.
