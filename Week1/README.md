# Reading Material Browsers Week 1

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 1:

1. [What is a web browser?](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/browser)
   - How a browser works
   - Different browsers work differently
1. [Refresher on DOM & DOM manipulation](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/explore/tree/main/Week4)
1. [Presenting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module)
1. [Career Training I (Your personal brand)](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand) - Not all this week!

## Week goals
All of the detailed information about every concept is in your study book. The following goal explanation will link you to the correct place to get studying. Read through the goal description once to get an idea of what you will be learning, then go through the different links (either from the agenda or this goal list).

This week we will do a little refresher of things you learned in the explore module and start working on our soft skills. Let's first take a closer look at browsers and how they work over [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/browser).

In the project of next week you will need to manipulate the DOM a lot so refresh your knowledge of those topics that were covered in the explore module over [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/explore/tree/main/Week4).

We will also work on our soft skills by reading up on the principles of presenting in the [presentation module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module/). 

## Career training I (Your personal brand)

During this module, you will also learn about the different components that make your personal brand (CV, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc). We have compiled all important info for you in [this repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand). Be sure to read the full repo for the Career Training session that will happen during this module and start working on your personal brand which you will have to hand in at the end of Browsers week 3!

> Note: While working with the DOM we need to also keep thinking about how we can test what we build. Testing using the DOM gets a lot more complicated as we need to somehow interact with the browser during our tests which is not easy. There are ways to do it, but later on in the curriculum we will be going into frontend frameworks that will actually take a lot of the difficulty away. This means for now that we will not be testing our code (if you are interested, your homework is being tested using JSDOM, you can have a look at those tests).
