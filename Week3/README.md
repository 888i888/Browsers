# Reading Material Browsers Week 3

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 3:

1. [Group Project!](../PROJECT.md)
  - Sunday: Group demonstrations and feedback on the projects
  - Mock interview (Test)
2. [Final individual presentation](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module/blob/main/assignment2.md)
3. [Career Training I](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand): Not all at once!

## Week goals
For most of this week you are going to be finishing up your project, there are no new reading materials! Have a look at the project explanation [here](../PROJECT.md) to see what is expected.

You will also get a message from one of the HYF core members to plan a time for your final presentation for the presentation module. See [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module/blob/main/assignment2.md) what is expected then.

> Note: While working with the DOM we need to also keep thinking about how we can test what we build. Testing using the DOM gets a lot more complicated as we need to somehow interact with the browser during our tests which is not easy. There are ways to do it, but later on in the curriculum we will be going into frontend frameworks that will actually take a lot of the difficulty away. This means for now that we will not be testing our code (if you are interested, your assignment is being tested using JSDOM, you can have a look at those tests).

## Career training 1 (Your personal brand)

After the project you will have your first project that you can put on your CV! For now that is, as you will want to add many more in the future as you progress in your abilities. It is therefore time to start thinking about all of the steps required to start the job search and getting accepted to your first programming job. The first step to this will be handled in Career training 1: Your personal brand. This is all about making your CV, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. stand out. These are the first things employers will look at so it is your first impression and has to be great! We have compiled a big list of information about how to go about creating your personal brand in [this repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand).

### Career training 1: Planning

You don't have to do all of this at this moment. Before the end of the Browsers module you will get a message in your cohort channel about when the Career Training 1 session will be. *Before* that session make sure to have:
- Read the whole [personal brand repository](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand).
- Done the [assignment](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand/blob/main/yourcurriculum.md#4-submitting-your-cv-to-the-hyf-team) for the repository.
